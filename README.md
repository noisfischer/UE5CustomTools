This repository contains Python scripts I used to enhance my workflow in Unreal Engine 5. I mapped many of these tools to buttons on an Editor Utility Widget. Scripts include:
- Spawn commonly used Blueprints 100 units in front of the viewport camera in the UE editor
- Spawn tags on selected actors to enable mechanics like wall running, homing missiles, and vaultable objects
- Create a new level with basic atmospherics
- Spawn a variety of auto-populated master materials
- Create a new folder with subfolders via a GUI popup
